    "## Question 3: Face Recognition using Principal Component Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This question requires you to create a basic facial recognition system using a technique called principal component analysis (PCA) \n",
    "by projecting the face images on the feature space (face space) which best\n",
    "represents the variations among distinct faces. The face space is defined as the\n",
    "â€œEigenfaces\", which are the eigenvectors of the set of faces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of implementing this system is to recognize a person's face by comparing it to a pre-existing database of faces, and identifying the closest match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Link to paper on Eigenfaces: [https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~mturk/Papers/mturk-CVPR91.pdf](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~mturk/Papers/mturk-CVPR91.pdf)\n",

    "The AT&T face dataset contains a set of grayscale face images with dimensions 92x112. The images are organised in 40 directories (one for each subject), which have names of the form sX, where X indicates the subject number (between 1 and 40). In each of these directories, there are ten different images of that subject, which have names of the form Y.pgm, where Y is the image number for that subject (between 1 and 10). These 10 images per person are taken at different times, varying the lighting, facial expressions (open / closed eyes, smiling / not smiling) and facial details (glasses / no glasses). All the images were taken against a dark homogeneous background with the subjects in an upright, frontal position (with tolerance for some side movement). <b>Link:</b> [https://git-disl.github.io/GTDLBench/datasets/att_face_dataset/](https://git-disl.github.io/GTDLBench/datasets/att_face_dataset/)"
