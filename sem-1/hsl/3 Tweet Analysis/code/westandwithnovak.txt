On this day last year, @DjokerNole when asked how he feels about the RLA, he said It feels like my living room   He is certainly the KING of Melbourne Park &amp; nobody can deny that!  9 x Champ!   #WeStandWithNovak  @novakfanclub @jelenadjokovic https://t.co/mdrbDzK8i5
@TheBoiledEgg @MichalSamulski It's already 100% sold out lady, making your hatered and biased useless opinions toward the Greatest Athlete of All Time (N.Djokovic) irrelevant.  #Djokovic  #NoleGOAT #WeStandWithNovak

Macron refused to show his pcr test here, during the visit to our country. Good to know if France starts terrorize Djokovic when Roland Garros begins. #LetNovakPlay #WeStandWithNovak #OurBodyOurChoice #IDontWantToBeForcedIWantToChose I think that we should continue our offense.

What a beautiful human #Djokovic is.  We are lucky to live at a time where we have watched you grow into the player and man that you are.  To many more titles, weeks at #1, and successes all around.  #WeStandWithNovak #NoleFam https://t.co/MfA41kT6Xu

Folks, I will delete my profile soon, after removing all my content. I might return later.  Twitter police is censoring me because of sudden violations &amp; forcing me to delete &amp; acknowledge the violation, without showing me which one. Appeal declined by robot. #WeStandWithNovak
Novak has nothing to prove by playing AO again, hes streets ahead and cant see anyone catching him #novakdjokovik #WeStandWithNovak

I hate seeing the negative posts about @DjokerNole pointing out their hatred. Please just stop you are the problem. Daria Kasakina knows not what she speaks, he's not real. What?, is she real? She got her attention now push her aside  #WeStandWithNovak

@CristinaNcl Some solidarity from players great to see thank you @NMektic  #WeStandWithNovak
@Reggie61823972 I was the first one who said man he took a beating at the 2020RG finals.  Cause he did.  Say it like it is.  Or the 2021 USO... A well deserved win for Meddy. But this mistreatment just to show one's political muscle is not ok and we will not be silenced.  #WeStandWithNovak
Ridiculous "logic" of today's world. And not just double, but multiple standards! #NoleTheGenuine  the one and only @DjokerNole  Those who have eyes to see and hearts to feel #standwithNovak #istandwithNovak  #WeStandWithNovak https://t.co/WUJD3oIEaW

@_Sla_Vie_ @nytimes @CNN @BBCSport I don't beg for it, but I think the outlets should show some accountability for the blatant witch hunt which caused irreparable damage to #Djokovic's reputation, rankings, mental wellbeing by a man on their payroll. #WeStandWithNovak
@DjokovicPH @DjokerNole Thanks for the Compliment I hope young Daria stops her nonsense.  #WeStandWithNovak

Australian government inhumane treatment of refugees was also exposed and the plight of those in that hotel* i think officials  voted for them to be relocated  #novakdjokovic is not only tennis  but a man of courage, can't break him on court won't off court #WeStandWithNovak https://t.co/d5V6CxVo6r
@TennisWorlden Yes @CraigTiley The UNCOVENIENT TRUTH is not going to go away.. IT'S YOUR LEGACY. #WeStandWithNovak #NoleFam
If I were Novak Id sue the Australia government and the Aus open organizers/director Tiley for damages sustained and never ever go back to Australia again. They dont deserve to have the greatest player of all time and the nicest most gracious man on tour #WeStandWithNovak
@freda_toit @ouiserboudreaux @mpshe_shamai @alliswe75081657 @GmaElaine6 @DragicaLetica @Gabrielle_GP @KikiUrosevic @Lou__007 Yes, he definitely has a huge family all over the world. And he is loved.  #WeStandWithNovak  #NoleFam

Hey @nytimes this was your top  tennis contributor at the time... You ok with your med records being published? No? Then a public apology to #Djokovic is way overdue.  And a public statement on #benrothenberg and his unethical reporting.  #WeStandWithNovak #NoleFam https://t.co/d5oseRKJaJ

So aus can treat more ppl like criminals and deport them?  Like to Novak Djokovic who had a valid exemption, who was set up and lured here, who was wrongly treated like a criminal and was unfairly and wrongly deported cause aus didnt want him to win 21  #WeStandWithNovak https://t.co/H8o9ACwZz0

@10NewsFirst So you can locked them up as you did with Novak and Voracova? No thanks!! #WeStandWithNovak
NoThanks!  No one wants to visit after seeing what you do to people with valid visas and exemptions. Who wants to be locked up, stripped down and deported with valid visa and exemption? Never!! #WeStandWithNovak https://t.co/0aWCYykPkT
Sure! To end up locked, stripped and deported. No Thanks!! We know what the government does to valid exemption.  #WeStandWithNovak https://t.co/hCaXczLPON
@ChrissieEvert @AustralianOpen He won by Aus gov deporting Novak and by not being tested for any substances! #WeStandWithNovak
If one of the greatest mind that  walked the planet earth thinks that Novak was mistreated I think there shouldn't be any counter argument from Tennis Australia. Magnus supporting Novak speak volumes..  #Djokovic #WeStandWithNovak  https://t.co/9znC9VzuO8

@JANE79591745 @AustralianOpen @CraigTiley @ITFTennis @atptour @usopen Another glaring and painful example of #DoubleStandards and #media bias. For #Novak to rise above all these is so impressive.  #WeStandWithNovak #WeStandWithDjokovic #Djokovic
@pavyg @AustralianOpen @AdamAddicott @ITFTennis And I'm sure they are not alone.  I've always said, Novak was the only one whose papers were scrutinized when he could have just bought whatever documents he wanted.  But he was honest, brave, sincere.  When did we stop valuing that? #WeStandWithNovak #NoleFam
@Al_x_andra @NoleFanSRB Missing you so much @DjokerNole #WeStandWithNovak #WeStandWithDjokovic #NovakDjokovic

@chigrl Australian Government put Djokovic in Dentention although HE TESTED NEGATIVE for Covid he was not allowed to compete at Australian Open #Djokovic #WeStandWithNovak
@AnNa85032297 @StarWarriors3 The Biggest Love of my Life my mum Biljana always used to say that. She had the eyes that warmed your heart and brought sweetness gentleness and kindnes into your sole just by looking into them. My mum loved Novak. We all do #Djokovic #WeStandWithNovak

Rothenberg comes in for heavy criticism, quite rightly, as do others. Dan Silver is quite correct in saying that the way Novak was treated was abhorrent. Well worth reading and very interesting thoughts, including about pharmaceuticals and the vaccine! #WeStandWithNovak #NoleFam https://t.co/TK9rdxBEFW
