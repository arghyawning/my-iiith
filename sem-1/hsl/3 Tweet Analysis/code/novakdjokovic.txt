By definition, cult "hasa belief system that has the answers to all of life's questionsand offers a special solution to be gained only by following the leader's rules."  Leader's rules? Special solution? Belief system? #NovakDjokovic as being open minded is targeted by a cult
World No 1 #NovakDjokovic may still withdraw from next month's #IndianWells #tennis tournament, but his entry confirmation is the strongest sign yet he will change his #vaccination status in pursuit of more majors.   READ: https://t.co/zoGxwis3zu https://t.co/AhzzcPThfi
The rules are the rules and you cant be changing the rules for entertainment. It has to be sport first.  This sentence is super applicable to #NovakDjokovic case, too.   You cannot allow him to come only to change ur mind in the last minute. https://t.co/mIDoaK2EIx
#NovakDjokovic is the only athlete in history that is actively prevented from competing by mass media and governments.

@Brightside86 @ceejay12481 @TennisPodcast Your lack of credible information can be matched only by your ignorance. #NovakDjokovic fulfilled all requirements and followed all the rules, as confirmed on the court by a judge.
